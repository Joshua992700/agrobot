Superstore Dataset (Attached above)

 

Title: Order Performance & Returns Dashboard

 

Scenario: You are provided with three tables: Orders (with customer and shipping details), Returns (returned order IDs), and People (mapping sales reps to regions). Your goal is to create a Power BI report that analyzes sales performance, highlights returned orders, and evaluates regional performance by sales reps.

 

Requirements:

Choose Theme & Layout: Use a clean business theme; layout sections for Sales Overview, Returns, and Regional Performance.
Identify KPIs: Show Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold, Return Rate, and Sales by Segment.
Conditional Formatting & Tooltips: Highlight low-profit or returned items; tooltips to show discount and profit details.
Interactivity: Add filters for Region, Category, and Segment; drill-through to view returns by sales rep or product.
Row-Level Security: Restrict access by Region using the People tableâ€™s Region mapping.
 

Expected Output: A Power BI report displaying sales and returns insights with filters for product, region, and customer segment, plus secure access per region through RLS.

 

Note: Please ensure the dates are changed to current period which is 2025, while transforming dataset.
